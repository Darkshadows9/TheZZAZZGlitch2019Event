# TheZZAZZGlitch2019Event
My notes on THEZZAZZGlitch's 2019 April Fools event.

Will populate and clean up as I have time. Pwnage 4 is wholly unfinished at the moment and Pwnage 3 needs a spring cleaning.

To build, load the workspace vile in .vscode, then run the relevant build command. "Build All Release" or "Build All Debug" for the lazy.

I would suggest reading ISSOtm's writeup on the Pwnage challenges for context: https://eldred.fr/projects/fools2019

This was a team effort and couldn't have been done without the following people:
